<br>the fire flares less often
<br>screaming quietly behind
<br>steroids and soft clothes
<br>
<br>but at the slightest sign
<br>of a spark, a cigarette
<br>butt burnt into your skin,
<br>
<br>she playfully cries wolf:
<br>
<br>your skin soon whitens
<br>like a lambâ€™s soft wool,
<br>it sheds like its sheared,
<br>
<br>lichens ripping, fusing
<br>as if a sweater is sewn
<br>stitched & neatly knitted
<br>
<br>but you need a life vest:
<br>
<br>extinguishing fire flames
<br>involves drowning sheep
<br>dousing them in steroids
<br>
<br>until they are knee-deep
<br>wool muddied and pink
<br>your flesh medium-rare
